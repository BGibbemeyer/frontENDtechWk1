    <p>However, as you can see, these makeshift masks not only look as scary as the virus actually is,<br>
             but they leave your pet unprotected while also polluting our Earth with materials not as easily<br>
              broken down by the environment.</p>

    <p>Our masks are made of a new patented material that is breathable AS WELL AS filters germs with the <br>
            efficacy of an N95 mask!</p>

    <h4>Don't let your best friend and quarantine buddy lack style while being unprotected!</h4>
